# Sentiment_analysis-Ukraine-war
This project was conducted in the middle of the stress time of Ukraine war, hence I pulled the data on Reddit to see what they were talking and how they reacted with this war:
- Firstly, pulled the data from Reddit with topic is 'Ukraine'.
- Next, extract the sentiment scores of the titles of the posts.
- Plot a histogram of the sentiment scores
- Look at descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of the sentiment scores
- Examine the text for some of the highest and lowest sentiment scores
- Finally, I write a short analysis of the results and the process.
